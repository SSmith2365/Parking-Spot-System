# Parking Spot Detection System
A personal computer vision project for detecting parking spot occupancy at my apartment complex using an IP camera, OpenCV, YOLOv8 models, and a Raspberry Pi 5. The end goal is to deploy the model on a Raspberry Pi for autonomous, continuous, and real-time edge deployment. This project is still in the early stages. I will update the files as I make progress and complete significant steps. 

This is my first time working with a Computer Vision model. My education was in FinTech & Big Data Analytics. My background is more in the computational modeling, data science, and classical machine learning (ML) domains. I am very interested in both edge computing and robotics, so I want to start building skills to work in those areas. The main goal of publishing this repo is to show my skills to prospective employers and gain experience. 

## Features 
- Publicly safe frame capture script for data collection (data_collection.py) with placeholder RTSP stream.
- YOLOv8 batch inference script (run_yolo_inference.py) for processing images.
- Managed with Poetry for clean dependency handling.
- Data, most results, and model weights are ignored to keep the repo small and secure.
